# Stockvalue
What we did in our project is to compare how different methods work in stock price valuation of internet enterprises. Three valuation methods employed are Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) and Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model (BS).
DCF is in general the most common and fundamental method, which can be used to evaluate the present value of the expected future cash flows. However, the growth of internet enterprises is difficult to estimate since their intangible assets, R&D expenses and goodwill all account for a large proportion, and there are huge differences between internet enterprises and traditional industries in asset composition, risk premium and so on. Therefore, we will introduce MCS and BS as well to estimate the intrinsic value of AMZN stock in order to compare it with its market price on the valuation date and to investigate if the currently traded stock on the NYSE (New York Securities Exchange) is overvalued or undervalued.
